# React Weather App - Project Plan

## Project Overview

A modern, responsive weather application built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS that provides real-time weather information, 5-day forecasts, and location-based weather search functionality.

### Core Objectives
- Deliver a fast, accessible weather application with excellent user experience
- Provide accurate current weather and 5-day forecast data
- Implement responsive design for all device sizes
- Ensure high performance and reliability
- Maintain clean, maintainable codebase with comprehensive testing

## Feature Set

### Core Features
1. **Current Weather Display**
   - Real-time temperature, humidity, wind speed, and conditions
   - Weather icons representing current conditions
   - "Feels like" temperature and UV index
   - Sunrise/sunset times

2. **5-Day Forecast**
   - Daily high/low temperatures
   - Weather conditions for each day
   - Precipitation probability
   - Wind conditions

3. **Location Search**
   - City name search with autocomplete
   - Geolocation support for current location
   - Search history with local storage
   - Error handling for invalid locations

### Future Enhancements
- Hourly forecasts
- Weather maps and radar
- Severe weather alerts
- Multi-location tracking
- Weather comparison features
- Historical weather data

## Technology Stack

### Frontend Framework
- **Next.js 14+** - React framework with App Router
- **TypeScript** - Type safety and better developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework for responsive design

### State Management
- **React Context API** - For global state management
- **React Query/TanStack Query** - Server state management and caching
- **Zod** - Runtime type validation for API responses

### API Integration
- **WeatherAPI.com** - Primary weather data provider
- **Axios** - HTTP client for API requests
- **React Hook Form** - Form handling for search functionality

### Development Tools
- **ESLint** - Code linting and quality
- **Prettier** - Code formatting
- **Husky** - Git hooks for pre-commit checks
- **Jest & React Testing Library** - Unit and integration testing
- **Cypress** - End-to-end testing

### Deployment & Infrastructure
- **Vercel** - Deployment platform (optimized for Next.js)
- **GitHub Actions** - CI/CD pipeline
- **Sentry** - Error monitoring and tracking

## API Integration Strategy

### WeatherAPI.com Integration
- **Current Weather Endpoint**: `/current.json`
- **Forecast Endpoint**: `/forecast.json`
- **Search/Autocomplete**: `/search.json`

### Data Flow
1. User enters location search
2. App validates input and makes API call
3. Response data is validated with Zod schemas
4. Data is cached using React Query
5. UI updates with weather information

### Error Handling
- Network error fallbacks
- Invalid location handling
- Rate limiting management
- Graceful degradation

### Caching Strategy
- Client-side caching for 10 minutes
- Stale-while-revalidate pattern
- Local storage for search history
- Optimistic updates for better UX

## UI/UX Design Principles

### Design System
- **Mobile-first responsive design**
- **Consistent spacing and typography scale**
- **Accessible color palette with proper contrast**
- **Intuitive navigation and information hierarchy**

### User Experience
- **Fast initial load times** (<3 seconds)
- **Smooth animations and transitions**
- **Progressive enhancement**
- **Offline capability for cached data**
- **Intuitive error states and loading indicators**

### Accessibility (A11y)
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- High contrast mode support
- Reduced motion preferences

## Performance Considerations

### Core Web Vitals Targets
- **LCP**: <2.5s
- **FID**: <100ms
- **CLS**: <0.1

### Optimization Strategies
- **Next.js Image optimization**
- **Code splitting and lazy loading**
- **API response compression**
- **CDN caching for static assets**
- **Bundle size monitoring**

### Monitoring
- Real User Monitoring (RUM)
- Performance budget tracking
- Bundle analyzer integration
- Lighthouse CI integration

## Accessibility Requirements

### WCAG 2.1 Compliance
- **Perceivable**: Text alternatives, adaptable content, distinguishable
- **Operable**: Keyboard accessible, enough time, seizures and physical reactions
- **Understandable**: Readable, predictable, input assistance
- **Robust**: Compatible with assistive technologies

### Implementation Details
- Semantic HTML structure
- ARIA labels and roles
- Focus management
- Color contrast ratio ≥ 4.5:1
- Screen reader testing

## Development Workflow

### Git Strategy
- Feature branch workflow
- Conventional commits
- Pull request reviews required
- Semantic versioning

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: 80%+ coverage for utilities and components
- **Integration Tests**: Critical user flows
- **E2E Tests**: Core functionality
- **Performance Tests**: Regular Lighthouse audits

### Code Quality
- Pre-commit hooks for linting and testing
- Automated code reviews
- Dependency updates monitoring
- Security vulnerability scanning
